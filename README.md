# minesweeper
Minesweeper written in Python with TKinter. 

Things it solves:
  - I was tired of clicking and getting just one cell revealed, because then a guess is required. This version will build a new board if the current board doesn't have an empty space on your first click.

Things it will solve in the future:
  - After a game is finished (victory or loss), I want to display the cells cleared per second and mines flagged per second statistic, because my friends had a competition for the best per second stats.
  - I'm hoping to add a hint feature. 

TODO:
 - Clicking on a mine doesn't end the game yet
 - Clearing the board doesn't end the game yet
 - Chording is not supported yet
 - Make the GUI at the top look cleaner.
